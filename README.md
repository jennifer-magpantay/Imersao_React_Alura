# Imersao_React_Alura
SPA built using React. This mini project was developed during #ImersaoReact, a full week of content provided by Alura and its hosts. 

The main goal of the project is created a NetFlix clone app. As I was improving the application and facing new challenges, I was adding or changind few features, applying knowledge from other tutorials, as Clever Programmer. Following that, I was able to use an API to import all movie content (url, pictures, title, description) and save into Firebase after all.
 
Status of the project: ongoing. Progress and results available @Firebase [here](https://lorem-ipsum-movies.web.app/)
